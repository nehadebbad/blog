                <p> The concept of race has always been confusing and has remained as one of the most difficult conundrums.

                It is often observed that every community that has been subjected to discrimination and ostracism has then gone to contribute its talents to the country’s social fabric thereby enriching the country not impoverishing it.But sometimes this can exacerbate the situation and make it less sanguine. How do you feel to be left out,forsaken and discouraged in small talk? Various terms have emerged from the roots of race. Few call it racial conflict or racial discrimination and few argue as racial profiling though all these terms are not under the purview of human understanding.</p>

                <p>There is a sheer boundary that exists between individuals which is often assumed to be a long journey. This boundary would be leveled when people stop assigning names and start communicating with each other thereby maintaining a rapport between themselves and contributing to peace.

                Racism prevents us from seeing humanity. Racism is not just limited to one race. It is believed that the victims of racism not only suffer from depression, stress, psychological trauma but also have problems with their social behaviour and self-esteem.They feel disconnected with the rest of the world and lag behind dominant societies in housing, education, employment and health outcomes. Their concentration and learning are greatly affected by unintended racism.The bedlam fuels outrage among the victims which foists them to adopt new ideologies to protect their communities and overcome rejection.

                In order to face rejection, people tend to choose alternative ways such as terrorism resulting in more rejection and in turn more violent practices and the chain is unremitting.Another issue that caused havoc and backlash against Americans is the stop and frisk policy in New York which targeted immigrants especially muslims. This policy not only questioned about their nationality and immigration status but also resulted in harassment and prosecution for minor offenses.</p>
                <p> Most of the Americans in fact most of the people draw nuances between ideologies of extremist groups and mainstream Islam. Therefore muslims are deprived of compassion. The stereotypical image of a muslim created due to lack of exposure has begun to cause differences.In the recent times when a professor was questioned about discussing racial conflicts with children, he rejected the idea of talking about violence against Blacks as it would only make them vulnerable to attacks. His response was unimpressive as it does not contribute to a healthy future of children. Social interaction and accepting other cultures must be taught from childhood.

                The situation in the present days has changed from unbearable to surmountable .We can contribute to world’s change only when the change starts within us.</p>
